## Why Do We Need It?

The [Azure AI project](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-projects) is used to _organize your work and save state, while you build custom AI apps_. Projects are hosted on an Azure AI resource. This is what the **final Azure AI project** looks like at the end of our workshop. Note how it is the single destination for discovering and configuring the various components required to _build_ our AI application.
